CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) 
(each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to allow the public to use their Work under specified conditions while restricting modification and derivation from the original. 
This allows for wider use of the Work while maintaining control over its integrity.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating 
this modified CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply 
this modified CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms.

1. Copyright and Related Rights
A Work made available under this modified CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").

2. Usage Rights
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Affirmer grants the public the right to:

Use the Work in any format or medium for non-commercial purposes.
Reproduce the Work as-is without modification or derivative creation.
Share the Work with proper attribution to the original author.
3. Limitations on Modification
No modifications, adaptations, or derivative works of the original Work are permitted. The integrity of the original Work must be maintained.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers
a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed, or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express or implied.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work.
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this modified CC0 
or use of the Work.
